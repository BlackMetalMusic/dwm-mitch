dwm-mitch history

### v4.0    2016-03-15

 - changes/improvements:
   - dwm features:
     - sticky mode for clients (visible on every workspace)
       - command: togglesticky (no parameters)
       - default keybinding: M+C+s
     - shows sticky/floating status of clients in statusbar
       - configure via clientstat[] in dwm/config.def.h
     - save and restore client positions and workspace layouts during
       dwm restart
     - make dialog and splash windows float by default (by checking
       for _NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE_DIALOG and _NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE_SPLASH
       atoms)
     - limit window refresh on mousemove() and resizemouse() to 60 Hz,
       enabling smoother movement of running videos and the like
       - configure via REFRESH_HZ in dwm/config.def.h
     - multi-screen features:
       - snap clients to all screen borders on mousemove() instead of
         just the overall desktop borders
       - automatically attach client to the screen it has most window
         area on after mousemove()
   - dwm configuration:
     - button clicks can be configured via dwm/config.def.h
     - dwm/config.h intermediate file removed, use dwm/config.def.h
       for your personal configuration
   - dwm Makefile updates:
     - all installation directories are configurable
     - install session icon for lightdm-gtk-greeter in Debian 8
     - uninstall everything that has been installed and try to remove
       all directories created on installation (only when empty of
       course)
     - compile with -flto, resulting in even smaller binaries

 - bugfixes:
   - use dwm-choose as program starter in dwm standard configuration
     instead of calling dmenu manually (dwm-choose was added some
     years ago for exactly this purpose but it was never used...)
   - add fake support for _NET_WM_STATE and _NET_WM_STATE_FULLSCREEN
     - This fixes a long-standing bug where Firefox would freeze in
       fullscreen mode.  While Firefox is the real culprit, a
       workaround in dwm-mitch seemed reasonable because it's a very
       annoying situation.  Firefox 46+ should fix this once and for
       all, see https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1189622
       but I think I'll just keep this fix anyway.

### v3.9    2015-05-24

 - changes/improvements:
   - new command 'swapscreen' (default keybinding: M+S+s)
     Allow moving all clients to another screen at once, effectively
     providing a "swap screens" function on dual-monitor setups.
     Set SWAPSCREEN_LAYOUT to control whether layouts are also swapped
     or kept.
   - execute ~/.dwm-startup on dwm start, useful for autostarting
     things when running via dwm-mitch.desktop Xsession
   - remove status script ownership check
   - add a dwm-mitch logo as icon for Xsession and Unity greeter
   - create and remove /usr/share/xsessions as needed on (un)install

 - bugfixes:
   - hide disabled bar on an above/below multiscreen configuration
   - fix partly concealed background on bottom bar configuration
   - fix position of popups on multiscreen configuration, don't always
     appear on screen 0
